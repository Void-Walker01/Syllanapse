        # CHC303 Process Design and Economics: Process Design Study Guide

## 1. Concise Bullet-Point Summary:

* **General Design Considerations:** encompass health and safety, loss prevention, environmental protection, plant location, layout, operation, and patent considerations.
* **Health and Safety Hazards:**  involve **safety hazards** (immediate injury) and **health hazards** (long-term effects).  Exposure sources, evaluation, control, fire/explosion hazards, personnel safety, and regulations are key.
* **Loss Prevention:** aims to minimize financial losses from accidents.  This includes identifying hazards, controlling them, and limiting losses during accidents.
* **Hazard Assessment Techniques:** include **HAZOP (Hazard and Operability Study)**, **FTA (Fault Tree Analysis)**, **FMEA (Failure Mode and Effect Analysis)**, safety indexes, and safety audits.
* **HAZOP:** uses **guide words** (NO, MORE, LESS, AS WELL AS, PART OF, REVERSE, OTHER THAN) to identify deviations from normal operation and potential hazards.
* **FTA:** estimates accident likelihood by breaking down contributing sequences using AND and OR gates.  Probabilities are expressed as yearly rates.
* **FMEA:** evaluates consequences of equipment failures.
* **Safety Indexes (e.g., Dow Fire and Explosion Index):** quantify process hazards based on material factors and process characteristics.
* **Safety Audits:** utilize checklists to review safety, health, and loss prevention aspects.
* **Plant Location & Layout:** critical for efficient operations and safety.
* **Plant Operation & Control:** requires careful planning for efficient and safe running.
* **Patent Considerations:** protect intellectual property related to the design.


## 2. Prioritized 3-Hour Study Plan:

**Hour 1: Foundations (0:00 - 1:00)**

* (0:00 - 0:15): Review General Design Considerations and Health & Safety Hazards.  Focus on definitions of safety and health hazards and sources of exposure.

* (0:45 - 1:00):  Brief overview of all hazard assessment techniques (HAZOP, FTA, FMEA, Safety Indexes, Safety Audits).


**Hour 2: Hazard Assessment Techniques (1:00 - 2:00)**

* (1:00 - 1:30):  Detailed study of HAZOP. Understand guide words and their application in identifying deviations. Work through examples.
* (1:30 - 2:00):  Focus on FTA.  Learn AND and OR gates, probability calculations, and how to interpret a fault tree.


**Hour 3:  Remaining Topics & Review (2:00 - 3:00)**

* (2:00 - 2:15):  Quickly review FMEA, Safety Indexes (focus on Dow F&EI), and Safety Audits.
* (2:15 - 2:45): Practice multiple-choice questions and review key concepts from the entire module.
* (2:45 - 3:00): Final review of any remaining weak areas.

        ## CHC303 Process Design and Economics: Process Design - General Design Considerations

**Module:** Process Design
**Semester:** 5th Semester BTech (Chemical Engg.)
**Instructor:** Dr. D. Krishna Sandilya
**Institute:** IIT (ISM), Dhanbad
**Semester:** Monsoon Semester (2025-2026)


**I. Health and Safety Hazards**

* **Safety Hazard:**  A material causing immediate injury upon exposure (high toxicity).
* **Health Hazard:** A material causing effects only after prolonged exposure at low concentrations (industrial health and hygiene hazard).
* **Factors influencing health hazard:**
    * Inherent toxicity of the material.
    * Frequency and duration of exposure.
* **Key Aspects:**
    * Sources of exposure
    * Exposure evaluation
    * Control of exposure hazards
    * Fire and explosion hazards
    * Personnel safety
    * Safety regulations


**II. Loss Prevention**

* **Definition of Loss:** Financial loss associated with accidents, including:
    * Repair/replacement costs.
    * Damage claims.
    * Lost production earnings.
    * Lost sales opportunities.
* **Process of Loss Prevention:**
    * Hazard identification and assessment.
    * Hazard control (containment, improved maintenance).
    * Process control (preventing hazardous conditions using automatic controls, relief systems, alarms).
    * Limiting loss during accidents.
* **Hazard Assessment Techniques:**
    * Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP)
    * Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)
    * Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)
    * Safety Indexes
    * Safety Audits


**III. Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP)**

* **Purpose:** Identify plant/equipment hazards and operability problems.
* **Method:**  Examine each segment (pipeline, equipment, instrument) by defining its intent and applying guide words to identify deviations from normal operation.
* **Guide Words:**  Used to systematically explore potential deviations.
    * **NO/NOT:** Negation of intention (e.g., no flow).
    * **MORE:** Quantitative increase (e.g., higher temperature).
    * **LESS:** Quantitative decrease (e.g., lower pressure).
    * **AS WELL AS:** Qualitative increase (e.g., an impurity).
    * **PART OF:** Quantitative decrease (e.g., only one component in a mixture).
    * **REVERSE:** Opposite (e.g., backflow).
    * **OTHER THAN:** Complete substitution (e.g., flow of wrong material).


**IV.  HAZOP Detailed Procedure**

(Refer to Figure 8.9 in the original notes for a visual representation of the detailed HAZOP examination sequence)  The procedure involves systematically examining each vessel, line, and auxiliary system on a flowsheet, applying guide words to identify deviations, possible causes, consequences, and required actions.


**V. Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)**

* **Purpose:** Estimate the likelihood of an accident by breaking it down into contributing sequences.
* **Method:** Constructs a logic diagram (fault tree) using AND and OR gates to represent event relationships.  Probabilities of events are expressed as yearly rates.
* **Logic Gates:**
    * **AND Gate:**  All lower-order events must occur for the higher-order event to happen. Probability of higher-order event = product of probabilities of lower-order events.
    * **OR Gate:**  Occurrence of any one lower-order event causes the higher-order event. Probability of higher-order event = sum of probabilities of lower-order events.
* **Procedure:** The accident is broken down into contributing sequences and individual events, graphically showing the relationship between events and undesired consequences.  (Examples 1 and 2 in original notes provide visual illustrations).


**VI. Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)**

* **Purpose:** Evaluate consequences of component failures on the process and surroundings.
* **Application:** Typically applied to specific equipment or hazardous parts of a process.
* **Limitation:** Does not consider errors in operating procedures or operator errors.


**VII. Safety Indexes (Dow Fire and Explosion Index - F&EI)**

* **Purpose:** Evaluate process hazards and assess safety/loss prevention measures.
* **Calculation:** Based on material factor (MF), general process hazard factor (F1), special process hazard factor (F2).  F3 = F1 x F2; F&EI = MF x F3.
* **Hazard Levels:**  Defined by F&EI ranges (Light, Moderate, Intermediate, Heavy, Severe).


**VIII. Safety Audits**

* **Purpose:** Comprehensive checklists covering safety, health, and loss prevention aspects.  Used as a guide for less experienced personnel and reviews general safety rules.  Provide safety rules for new process areas and emergency response procedures.
* **Checklist Questions:**  Promotes critical thinking by asking: Is it needed?  What are the alternatives? Has provision been made? Has it been checked/provided?

General Design Considerations
2. Loss Prevention
Failure Mode – and – Effect Analysis (
FMEA
) –
Limited use

Usually  applied  to  a  specific  piece  of  equipment  in  aprocess
or
a
particularly
hazardous
part
of
a
larger
process
or
a
particularly
hazardous
part
of
a
larger
process.

The purpose of FMEA is to evaluate the consequence ofthe    component    failures    on    the    process    andsurroundings.

Drawback:
FMEA  does  not  consider  the  errors  in
operating   procedures   or   those   committed   by   theoperators.

Developed by the
Dow Chemical Company.

A  method  for  evaluating  the  potential  hazards  of  aprocess  and  assessing  the  safety  and  loss  preventionmeasures needed.

The Dow Fire and Explosion Index is calculated, based onthe  nature  of  the  process  and  properties  of  thematerials.

Calculation of the 
Dow Fire and Explosion Index (F&EI)
1.  Material factor (MF), which is
a measure of the intrinsic
rate
of
energy
release
from
the
burning,
explosion,
or
rate
of
energy
release
from
the
burning,
explosion,
or
chemical reaction of the material
, is estimated.
2.  The general process hazard factor (F
1
) is calculated .
e.g.,
an exothermic reaction
3.  The special process hazard factor (F
2
) is estimated.
e.g.,
operating conditions, proximity to flammable areas
