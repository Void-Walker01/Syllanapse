## 1. Concise Bullet-Point Summary:

* **General Design Considerations:** encompass health and safety, loss prevention, environmental protection, plant location, layout, operation, and patent considerations.
* **Health and Safety Hazards:**  involve **safety hazards** (immediate injury) and **health hazards** (long-term effects).  Exposure sources, evaluation, control, fire/explosion hazards, personnel safety, and regulations are key.
* **Loss Prevention:** aims to minimize financial losses from accidents.  This includes identifying hazards, controlling them, and limiting losses during accidents.
* **Hazard Assessment Techniques:** include **HAZOP (Hazard and Operability Study)**, **FTA (Fault Tree Analysis)**, **FMEA (Failure Mode and Effect Analysis)**, safety indexes, and safety audits.
* **HAZOP:** uses **guide words** (NO, MORE, LESS, AS WELL AS, PART OF, REVERSE, OTHER THAN) to identify deviations from normal operation and potential hazards.
* **FTA:** estimates accident likelihood by breaking down contributing sequences using AND and OR gates.  Probabilities are expressed as yearly rates.
* **FMEA:** evaluates consequences of equipment failures.
* **Safety Indexes (e.g., Dow Fire and Explosion Index):** quantify process hazards based on material factors and process characteristics.
* **Safety Audits:** utilize checklists to review safety, health, and loss prevention aspects.
* **Plant Location & Layout:** critical for efficient operations and safety.
* **Plant Operation & Control:** requires careful planning for efficient and safe running.
* **Patent Considerations:** protect intellectual property related to the design.

        ## CHC303 Process Design and Economics: Process Design - General Design Considerations

**Module:** Process Design
**Semester:** 5th Semester BTech (Chemical Engg.)
**Instructor:** Dr. D. Krishna Sandilya
**Institute:** IIT (ISM), Dhanbad
**Semester:** Monsoon Semester (2025-2026)


**I. Health and Safety Hazards**

* **Safety Hazard:**  A material causing immediate injury upon exposure (high toxicity).
* **Health Hazard:** A material causing effects only after prolonged exposure at low concentrations (industrial health and hygiene hazard).
* **Factors influencing health hazard:**
    * Inherent toxicity of the material.
    * Frequency and duration of exposure.
* **Key Aspects:**
    * Sources of exposure
    * Exposure evaluation
    * Control of exposure hazards
    * Fire and explosion hazards
    * Personnel safety
    * Safety regulations


**II. Loss Prevention**

* **Definition of Loss:** Financial loss associated with accidents, including:
    * Repair/replacement costs.
    * Damage claims.
    * Lost production earnings.
    * Lost sales opportunities.
* **Process of Loss Prevention:**
    * Hazard identification and assessment.
    * Hazard control (containment, improved maintenance).
    * Process control (preventing hazardous conditions using automatic controls, relief systems, alarms).
    * Limiting loss during accidents.
* **Hazard Assessment Techniques:**
    * Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP)
    * Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)
    * Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)
    * Safety Indexes
    * Safety Audits


**III. Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP)**

* **Purpose:** Identify plant/equipment hazards and operability problems.
* **Method:**  Examine each segment (pipeline, equipment, instrument) by defining its intent and applying guide words to identify deviations from normal operation.
* **Guide Words:**  Used to systematically explore potential deviations.
    * **NO/NOT:** Negation of intention (e.g., no flow).
    * **MORE:** Quantitative increase (e.g., higher temperature).
    * **LESS:** Quantitative decrease (e.g., lower pressure).
    * **AS WELL AS:** Qualitative increase (e.g., an impurity).
    * **PART OF:** Quantitative decrease (e.g., only one component in a mixture).
    * **REVERSE:** Opposite (e.g., backflow).
    * **OTHER THAN:** Complete substitution (e.g., flow of wrong material).


**IV.  HAZOP Detailed Procedure**

(Refer to Figure 8.9 in the original notes for a visual representation of the detailed HAZOP examination sequence)  The procedure involves systematically examining each vessel, line, and auxiliary system on a flowsheet, applying guide words to identify deviations, possible causes, consequences, and required actions.


**V. Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)**

* **Purpose:** Estimate the likelihood of an accident by breaking it down into contributing sequences.
* **Method:** Constructs a logic diagram (fault tree) using AND and OR gates to represent event relationships.  Probabilities of events are expressed as yearly rates.
* **Logic Gates:**
    * **AND Gate:**  All lower-order events must occur for the higher-order event to happen. Probability of higher-order event = product of probabilities of lower-order events.
    * **OR Gate:**  Occurrence of any one lower-order event causes the higher-order event. Probability of higher-order event = sum of probabilities of lower-order events.
* **Procedure:** The accident is broken down into contributing sequences and individual events, graphically showing the relationship between events and undesired consequences.  (Examples 1 and 2 in original notes provide visual illustrations).


**VI. Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)**

* **Purpose:** Evaluate consequences of component failures on the process and surroundings.
* **Application:** Typically applied to specific equipment or hazardous parts of a process.
* **Limitation:** Does not consider errors in operating procedures or operator errors.


**VII. Safety Indexes (Dow Fire and Explosion Index - F&EI)**

* **Purpose:** Evaluate process hazards and assess safety/loss prevention measures.
* **Calculation:** Based on material factor (MF), general process hazard factor (F1), special process hazard factor (F2).  F3 = F1 x F2; F&EI = MF x F3.
* **Hazard Levels:**  Defined by F&EI ranges (Light, Moderate, Intermediate, Heavy, Severe).


**VIII. Safety Audits**

* **Purpose:** Comprehensive checklists covering safety, health, and loss prevention aspects.  Used as a guide for less experienced personnel and reviews general safety rules.  Provide safety rules for new process areas and emergency response procedures.
* **Checklist Questions:**  Promotes critical thinking by asking: Is it needed?  What are the alternatives? Has provision been made? Has it been checked/provided?

The purpose of FMEA is to evaluate the consequence ofthe    component    failures    on    the    process    andsurroundings.

Drawback:
FMEA  does  not  consider  the  errors  in
operating   procedures   or   those   committed   by   theoperators.

**1. Concise Bullet-Point Summary:**

* **Time Value of Money (TVM):** Money received today is worth more than the same amount received in the future due to its potential earning capacity.
* **Interest:** A charge for borrowing money, representing the cost of credit.
* **Compounding:** Interest earned on both principal and accumulated interest.  This leads to exponential growth of debt or investment.
* **Risk and Return:**  Higher risk investments generally offer a higher potential return (interest).
* **Present Worth:** The current value of a future sum of money.
* **Future Worth:** The value of an investment at a specified date in the future.
* **Interest Rate:** The percentage charged on borrowed money or earned on invested money.  A crucial factor in TVM calculations.
* **Comparing Values Across Time:**  Requires adjusting values using an appropriate interest rate.
* **Investment Decisions:**  TVM is fundamental for evaluating the financial viability of projects.
* **Economic Analysis:** TVM aids in comparing different investment options with varying timelines.
* **Usury:** Historically, the term for charging excessive interest (ethically problematic).

        ## CHC303 Process Design and Economics: Process Economics Exam Study Notes

**Module:** Process Economics
**Semester:** 5th Semester BTech (Chemical Engg.)
**Instructor:** Dr. D. Krishna Sandilya
**IIT (ISM), Dhanbad**


**I. Core Concepts:**

* **Time Value of Money (TVM):** This is the central concept of this module.  Understanding why money available today is worth more than the same amount in the future is crucial. This is due to its potential earning capacity through investment.

* **Interest:**  The cost of borrowing money or the return on lending it.  A deep understanding of simple and compound interest calculations is essential.

    * **Simple Interest:**  Interest calculated only on the principal amount.
    * **Compound Interest:** Interest calculated on the principal amount plus accumulated interest. This leads to exponential growth of the investment or debt.

* **Interest Rate:** The percentage charged or earned on a loan or investment over a specific period.  Factors influencing interest rates (risk, inflation, market conditions) should be understood.

* **Present Worth (PW):**  The current value of a future sum of money or a series of future cash flows, discounted at a specific interest rate.

* **Future Worth (FW):** The value of a sum of money or a series of cash flows at a specified future date, compounded at a given interest rate.

* **Annual Worth (AW):** The equivalent uniform annual cost or benefit over a specified period.  Useful for comparing projects with different lifespans.

* **Rate of Return (ROR):** The percentage return on an investment over a specific period.  Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is a key metric for project evaluation.


**II. Important Questions for the Exam:**

1.  **Explain the concept of Time Value of Money and its importance in process economics.**  Provide real-world examples illustrating its significance.

2.  **Differentiate between simple interest and compound interest.  Calculate the future value of an investment using both methods.**  Show your workings.

3.  **Describe the factors that influence interest rates.** How do these factors affect investment decisions?

4.  **Solve problems involving present worth, future worth, and annual worth calculations.**  Include scenarios with different interest rates and time horizons.

5.  **Explain the concept of the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and its application in project evaluation.**  Compare and contrast IRR with other methods like Net Present Value (NPV).

6.  **Discuss the role of risk and uncertainty in process economic analysis.** How are these factors incorporated into project evaluations?

7.  **Analyze a case study involving a capital investment decision.**  Use relevant economic evaluation techniques to determine the feasibility of the project.

8.  **Compare and contrast different methods for economic analysis of chemical engineering projects.**  Discuss their strengths and weaknesses.  Examples include Payback Period, Discounted Payback Period,  NPV, IRR, and AW.


**III. Recommended Study Resources:**
