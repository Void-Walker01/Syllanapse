General Design Considerations
1. Health and Safety Hazards
a) Safety HazardA  highly  toxic  material  that  causes  immediateinjury is classified as a
safety hazard
.
b) Health HazardA material whose effect is apparent only after long
 
exposure at low concentrations is considered as an 
industrial health and hygiene hazard
.

General Design Considerations
1. Health and Safety Hazards
The potential
health hazard
to an individual by a
material  used  in  any  chemical  or  biochemicalprocess is a function of the
inherent toxicity
of the
material  and  the
frequency  and  duration  of
exposure

General Design Considerations
2. Loss Prevention
Loss
in  a  chemical  industry  refers  to  the
financial  loss
associated with an accident.Consequences of 
Loss
Consequences of 
Loss
1)  Cost of repairing (or) replacing the damaged faci
lity.
2)  Taking care of all damage claims.3)  Loss of earnings from lost production during the 
repair 
period.
4)  Any associated lost sale opportunities.

General Design Considerations
2. Loss Prevention
Chemical processing is associated with a lot of hazards.
So,
the   design   engineer   must   try   to   minimize   the
Loss
associated with any accident.Process of 
Loss Prevention
Process of 
Loss Prevention
1)  Identification and assessment of the major hazards.2)  Control of the hazards by the most appropriate means
(e.g.,
containment,
improved maintenance
).
3)  Control  of  the  process
(e.g.,  Prevention  of  hazardous
conditions  in  process  operating  variables  by  utilizingautomatic control and relief systems, alarms, etc).
4)  Limitation of the 
Loss
when an accident occurs.

HAZOP 
Study

Uses  to  identify  all  plant  (or)  equipment  hazards  andoperability problems.

In this technique, each SEGMENT (i.e., pipeline, piece ofequipment, instrument, etc.) is carefully examined andall possible deviations from normal operating conditionsare identified.

This is accomplished by fully defining the
INTENT
of each
SEGMENT  and  then  applying
Guide  Words
to  each
SEGMENT.

The purpose of FMEA is to evaluate the consequence ofthe    component    failures    on    the    process    andsurroundings.

        ## Summary

* **General Design Considerations:**  Focuses on health & safety, loss prevention, environmental protection, plant location, layout, operation, and patent considerations.
* **Health & Safety Hazards:**  Differentiates safety hazards (immediate injury) from health hazards (long-term effects).  Considers exposure sources, evaluation, control, fire/explosion hazards, personnel safety, and regulations.
* **Loss Prevention:** Aims to minimize financial losses from accidents.  Includes identifying and assessing major hazards, controlling hazards (containment, maintenance), process control (automatic systems, alarms), and limiting losses during accidents.
* **Hazard Assessment Techniques:** Covers HAZOP, FTA, FMEA, safety indexes, and safety audits.
* **HAZOP (Hazard and Operability Study):** Uses guide words (NO, MORE, LESS, AS WELL AS, PART OF, REVERSE, OTHER THAN) to identify deviations from normal operation.
* **FTA (Fault Tree Analysis):** Estimates accident likelihood by breaking down contributing sequences using AND and OR gates.
* **FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis):** Evaluates consequences of component failures; limited use, doesn't consider operator errors.
* **Safety Indexes (Dow Fire and Explosion Index):**  Evaluates process hazards based on material factors and process hazard factors.
* **Safety Audits:** Use detailed checklists to cover safety, health, and loss prevention aspects.  Promotes proactive thinking and identification of potential issues.
* **Dow F&EI:** Categorizes hazard severity (Light, Moderate, Intermediate, Heavy, Severe) based on calculated index values.
* **Guide Words in HAZOP:** Used to systematically identify potential deviations and hazards during process design review.
* **Logic Gates in FTA:** AND gates represent necessary conditions; OR gates represent sufficient conditions for higher-order events.
