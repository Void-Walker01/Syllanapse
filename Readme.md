### **üöÄ How to Run This Project Locally**

#### **Prerequisites**
* Node.js (v18 or higher) and npm installed.
* A Google Gemini API Key.

#### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd syllanapse-ai
```
#### **2. Setup the Backend**
```bash
cd backend
npm install

# Create the environment file
cp .env.example .env
```
*Now, open the new .env file and add your Google Gemini API key:
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"*

#### **3. Setup the Frontend**
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```
#### **4. Run the Application**
You will need **two separate terminals** to run the application.

* **Terminal 1 (Backend):**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run dev
    ```
    *The server will be running on `http://localhost:4000`*

* **Terminal 2 (Frontend):**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
